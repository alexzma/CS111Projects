Notes:
I chose to implement this code using a combination of C and shell scripting.
The shell script preprocesses the lines of the csv, so they are easier to 
parse in the c program.
Then, in the C program, I can iterate through the preprocessed lines.
C is a faster language than certain other languages such as Python and 
C++, so it should finish within the time limit, unless the program 
does not work correctly.
Keeping track of memory allocation was not too much of an issue, because 
most of the memory allocation was either used throughout the whole program 
or only allocated within an iteration of a loop.
The lab3b shell script creates a temporary file named using $RAND. If all 
possible values of $RAND are names of files, the lab3 executable will have an 
infinite loop.
The clean target will attempt to remove any files that consist of purely numbers.

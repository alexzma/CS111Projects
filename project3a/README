PART 1: Exploring an EXT2 Image
I mounted the file system image using a Ubuntu virtual machine using the command:
sudo mount -o ro,loop EXT2_test.img fs
There was a lost+found directory, which I could not access, since I opened it as read only.
I looked through the other directories, then unmounted the file system image.
I also ran Debugfs. The stats command shows the superblock information. The stat command shows the information about 1 file. The bd command dumps a block's information. The testi command says whether a file's inode is marked as in use. The testb command says whether a block is marked as in use.

Files:
README: This file
Makefile: File that makes the program and executable with make targets
ext2_fs.h: Header file that contains some definitions for lab3a.c
lab3a.c: File that analyzes ext2 formatted file system images

Notes:
This program only works on ext2 formatted file system images with one group.
If there is an indirect reference to a directory entry, the INDIRECT line prints before the DIRENT line(s).
